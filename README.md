# Hi üëã

I'm a web developer passionate about **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Functional Programming**, and **software craftsmanship**. I love building scalable, maintainable software and improving workflows through well-tested and well-structured code.

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What I do
- **Web Development:** I develop in javaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like **Angular**.
- **Backend Development:** Experienced in **ASP.NET Core** for building robust APIs and services.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Strong advocate for writing reliable **tests** first.
- **Functional Programming (Work in Progress):** Exploring **FP paradigms** to write cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Open-Source Collaboration:** Actively contributing and open to pairing on projects.
