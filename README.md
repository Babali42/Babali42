# 👨‍💻 Web developer & apprentice software craftsman

Hi 👋
I'm a growing web developer eager to strengthen my skills in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Functional Programming**, and **Software Craftsmanship** as I continue learning and improving.

I enjoy working on code katas and exploring ways to make these exercises more accessible for others.

I'm currently looking for open-source projects to contribute to, especially in **.NET**, **Angular**, or **TypeScript**.
I'm a professional **.NET** developer and I'm currently learning **Scala** to broaden my understanding of functional programming.

## 📌 Hobby Project

### [Drum Beat Repo](https://github.com/Babali42/drum-beat-repo)

🎵 Explore, create and share drum patterns in your browser
**Tech stack:** Angular, Typescript, Web Audio API

## Code kata reports

- [Opening Hours](https://github.com/Babali42/kata-opening-hours)

## 🧮 Code katas projects templates with unit tests

You can use them for **code kata** or **training** !

Tested in **Jetbrains IDEs** (Webstorm and Rider) and it should work on other IDE or in command line tools

- ### [F#](https://github.com/Babali42/fsharp-template-with-fsunit-tests)
- ### [Haskell](https://github.com/Babali42/haskell-template-with-htest)
- ### [Scala](https://github.com/Babali42/scala-template-with-scalatest-and-mill)
- ### [Typescript](https://github.com/Babali42/ts-template-with-jest-tests)

## 🚀 Presentations

Each presentation lasts between about 15 and 30 minutes

### [Hexagonal Architecture Tests](https://github.com/Babali42/hexagonal-architecture-tests-in-15-minutes)

Understand architecture testing, hexagonal structure with bounded contexts, and testing with **Jest** and **arch-unit-ts** in an Angular app.

### [What is Functional in Multi-Paradigm Languages](https://github.com/Babali42/what-is-functional-in-oo-langages-in-45-minutes)

Explore functional programming concepts in multi-paradigm languages: types, immutability, recursion, and more.
**Examples in:** OCaml

### [CSS Selectors](https://github.com/Babali42/css-selectors-in-45-minutes)
### [CSS Architecture](https://github.com/Babali42/css-architecture-in-45-minutes)

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always open to pair programming, discussing architecture, or hacking on open-source.
